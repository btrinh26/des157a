                <p>The article, <a href=https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f>Best Practices for Design</a>, goes over some fundamental ideas and concepts about the design of a form that will be useful to me as a designer. Optimizing a website or form for the best user experience and retention is one of the main goals as a designer. The author goes over examples of this with just lowering down the amount of fields you have to enter. With stuff like surveys and forms, a sizable amount of people don’t finish them, because it takes time out of their day. Multiple steps is also a good way to build anticipation for a user. It lets the user know there is an endpoint and that they will be nearly done. Making the user experience is essential even if only a little bit. An example of this is highlighting the first field to be filled out. This saves nearly negligible time, but it still improves the user experience.<br><br>

                CalFresh’s application was very easy to navigate for me. Progress bar, explanations, and the one column layout was all there. I don’t think I had any problems with filling out the survey.

                <p>The Nielsen Norman Group article, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</a>, emphasizes that overlays should be simple, visually distinct, and easily accessible to users. The article points out common mistakes in overlay design, broken down into five categories: Who, What, When, Where, and Why. As a designer, I understand that we have to use overlays sparingly, ensuring they serve a clear purpose without annoying or disrupting users. While the article provides many examples of poor overlay use, I think intrusive overlays can still be effective in some cases. For example, websites like Pinterest, Forbes, or Facebook want users to have an account. To accomplish this, these websites use annoying and intrusive overlays to bug users into signing in. While this is effective for the website itself, it is still a poor experience for the user.
